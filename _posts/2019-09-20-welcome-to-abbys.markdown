Welcome to my personal blog space.

Quite some time ago I have developed a habit of taking notes whenever I felt like I have an interesting idea.
This is a good exercise - kind of like swapping memory pages into a long term storage. It frees your working memory.

It is also interesting to revisit your own notes from time to time. "what was I thinking back then?" or "Hey - this is not a bad idea at all!".
There are however downsides to taking notes - they do get lost. And it is never a good thing to lose good ideas.
Even worse - no one else can see this ideas. Shocking I know.

If only there was a way to store your notes in such a way that they can be easily shared with the world?
Maybe throw in a version control in.

Oh! Of course - there is a technology for that :)
So - here we are. Version controlled persistent and shareable memory dump also know as `blog`.  

I would mainly focus on Software Engineering in general and `modern C++` in particular.
With possibly some occasional musing about life in general.
